## Welcome to my portfolio!

#### built with react

<br>

Obviously humor is a very important component of my life, it's the lynchpin that keeps me locked in the realm of sane.

I am very new to developing, I would be lying if I said I often question if I actually understand what I've done and what I'm doing. But I've been told that's a natual feeling and it shouldn't ever really go away. Awesome!

But all jokes aside, this portfolio (made with react) is an example of what a person who's had no real training in coding prior, can turn around and do (with some help) in about 6 months.

The examples aren't perfect, they may break or look like someting your kid did in an after school program. But I can tell you that they're mine and that I did them with the understanding I had at the time. They confirm that I am still teachable and that I am still willing to learn.

Please enjoy... and smirk and giggle when you feel it appropriate.

## About the author

<br>

Born into the hospitality industry, Kaz spent much of his early adult life sweating in a hot bustling kitchen.

After spending some time abroad, he came back to Middle TN to finish his undergrad at MTSU. His BS is in Mass Comm (adv) with minors in Education and English.

After spending years as a brick and mortar business owner, Kaz shifted gears in 2014 and started dj in the downtown Nashville area.

In 2020, as did many others, Kaz found himself jobless and wondering what he would do to make ends meet. Years of design work and conceptulizing web and app ideas, brought him to the obvious conclusion; coding.

The 6 months Vanderbilt bootcamp, focusing on full stack development, has proven to be both challenging and rewarding. Kaz has a firm foundation to build from and a willingness and desire to learn and understand all that he can.
